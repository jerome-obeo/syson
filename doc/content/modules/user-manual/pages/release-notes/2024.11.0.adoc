= 2024.11.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights

== Breaking changes

- Add CaseUsage and CaseDefinition in General View diagram, the following classes have been renamed to reflect their new usage:
* Rename `UseCaseDefinitionActorsCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider` to `CaseDefinitionActorsCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider`
* Rename `UseCaseDefinitionObjectiveRequirementCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider` to `CaseDefinitionObjectiveRequirementCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider`
* Rename `UseCaseDefinitionSubjectCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider` to `CaseDefinitionSubjectCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider`
* Rename `UseCaseUsageActorsCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider` to `CaseUsageActorsCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider`
* Rename `UseCaseUsageObjectiveRequirementCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider` to `CaseUsageObjectiveRequirementCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider`
* Rename `UseCaseUsageSubjectCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider` to `CaseUsageSubjectCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider`
- Handle of aliases and external references have been improved for textual import, the following methods have been deleted:
* Deleted `AstTreeParser#resolveAllImport`
* Deleted `AstTreeParser#resolveAllReference`
* Deleted `ProxyResolver#resolveAllProxy`
- Add an edge tool to add target element as nested usage.
The following methods have been moved from `NodeCreationTestsService` to `SemanticCheckerService` to better separate testing concerns:
* `getElementInParentSemanticChecker`
* `checkEditingContext`
The following methods have been moved from `NodeCreationTestsService` to `DiagramCheckerService` to better separate testing concerns:
* `getChildNodeGraphicalChecker`
* `getCompartmentNodeGraphicalChecker`
* `getSiblingNodeGraphicalChecker`
* `checkDiagram`
- Remove default name of relationships and improve edge labels.
The method `getSuccessionLabel` in `ViewLabelService` has been deleted, succession labels are now computed with the generic `getEdgeLabel` method.
- Allow the drop of elements on empty diagram nodes.
Rename the class `SemanticCheckerFactory` to `SemanticRunnableFactory` to reflect the new use cases of the class.

== Dependencies update

- Switch to Spring Boot 3.3.3
- Migrate the frontend to `react 18.3.1`, `react-dom 18.3.1`, `react-router-dom 6.26.0`, `@xstate/react: 3.0.0` and `@ObeoNetwork/gantt-task-react 0.6.0`
- Switch to Sirius Web 2024.9.8
- Switch to `commons-io 2.17`

== Bug fixes
- Fix an issue that prevented the import of `Allocation` and `AllocationDefinition`.
- Fix import of some boolean properties of elements (Type#isAbstract, Feature#isDerived, Feature#isEnd, Feature#isReadOnly).

== Improvements

- Add CaseUsage and CaseDefinition representations in the General View diagram.
- Update Batmobile template.
- Handle of aliases and external references have been improved for textual import.
- Add support for short name in container and compartment item labels.
- Allow to set short name via the direct edit.
- Make Declared Short Name accessible from the Core tab instead of the Advanced tab in the details view.
- Remove default name of relationships and improve edge labels.
- Allow to create dependencies from the Explorer view.
- Allow the drop of elements on empty diagram nodes.
It is now possible to drop elements from the explorer on the information box visible on empty diagrams.
The dropped element is displayed on the diagram, the same way element creation tools on the information box display them on the diagram.
- Exclude `src/test/resources` from checkstyle.
This reduces the time required to build SysON, especially when using Spring Tool Suite.
- Add `New Subsetting` tool on `PartUsage` to create a `Subsetting` edge and a `PartUsage` that is subset.
- Add `New Feature Typing` tool on `PartUsage` to create a `FeatureTyping` edge and a `PartDefinition`.
- Add `New Binding Connector As Usage` tool on `PartUsage` in Interconnection view diagram.
- Add `New Flow Connection` tool on `PartUsage` in Interconnection view diagram.

== New features

- Add a new Custom node representing Ã  _Note_ among possible node style descriptions available. 
The custom node is resizable and the text content is wrapped (back to the line) if it is too long compare to the node size.
- Represent `Documentation` as _Note_ graphical node. 
The `Documentation` graphical node can appear when user drag and drop `Documentation` element from explorer on the diagram.
The `Documentation` graphical node is linked to its documented element by an edge and the node can only appear if the documented element is represented on the diagram.
- Display prefix keywords in labels of `Documentation` graphical nodes.

- Allow creation of `Comment` from the Explorer view.
- Add `Comment` representation in graphical views. 
The `Comment` graphical node can appear when user drag and drop `Comment` element from explorer on the diagram but also when user handle creation tool from the palette.
The `Comment` graphical node is linked to its annotated element by an edge and the node can only appear if the annotated element is represented on the diagram.
- Display prefix keywords in labels of `Comment` graphical nodes.

- Add `Comment` property to Core tab of the Details view, allowing to add/edit a `Comment` for the selected element.
This property widget will only handle the first `Comment` associated to the selected element.
If no `Comment` is associated to the selected element, then a new value in this widget will also create a `Comment` element and will associate it to the selected element.
- Add declaredName attribute in annotating export file result if the annotatingElement contains a declaredName.
- Add an edge tool to add target element as nested usage.
This complements the existing tool that allows to add the source element as a nested usage of the target.
